*In order to be eligible for Stage 2, each team's Stage 1 submission must include the model uploaded, via Team -> Your Model, per the Competition Rules. This model should match that which was used to generate the 1 final submission selected for scoring. Be aware that if you do not select a final submission (via 'My Submissions'), the platform will auto-select your best-scoring model on the Stage 1 public leaderboard. The deadline for model upload is firmly the end of Stage 1.

This requirement is in place for the host team to verify the performance of the uploaded models matches the Stage 2 submission file. Compliance with the above will be verified by the host team. Submitters who fail to upload their model by the Stage 1 deadline, or are found not to be in compliance, may be disqualified from Stage 2 and removed from the final leaderboard.

All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.
